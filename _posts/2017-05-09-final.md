*TL;DR:*

In an age that simplifies and destigmafies piracy and plagiarism,   
Since 2010, black hat hackers [exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LeY9qJVcU6BMXRiYLFml5GVtv_FnfL6N41fDGl6qWVs/edit#gid=0) have targeted "Syrian citizens, human rights activists, and the defense and aerospace industry." Contrastingly, white hat hacking, or ethical hacking, can amount to unlimited and unimaginable moral opportunities from protecting the United States to building an independently-made self-driving car. Nonetheless, with such power comes the burdening responsibility to uphold ethicality. The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/postlive/the-ethics-of-hacking-101/2014/10/07/39529518-4014-11e4-b0ea-8141703bbf6f_story.html?utm_term=.e645a6b02b4d) reports that "in a world in which businesses, the military and governments rely on computer systems that are potentially vulnerable, having the ability to break into those systems provides a strategic advantage." To combat the detritments of not only criminal but governmental misuse of software, multiplatform companies like Google are [hiring researchers](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/15/google-project-zero_n_5589337.html) to find zero-day vulnerabilities before others. Since its creation in 2014, Google's elite team, coined [Project Zero](https://security.googleblog.com/2014/07/announcing-project-zero.html), aims to "focus on the supply of these high value vulnerabilities and eliminate them” and has detected imminently dangerous flaws such as [Cloudbleed](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1139) and [Window's 8.1 software](https://www.engadget.com/2015/01/02/google-posts-unpatched-microsoft-bug/). Project Zero's founder [Chris Evens](https://www.wired.com/2014/07/google-project-zero/) believes that "people deserve to use the internet without fear that vulnerabilities out there can ruin their privacy with a single website visit." With the threat of black hat hackers increasing in number, movements such as [Anonymous](http://abcnews.go.com/US/worldwide-hacker-group-anonymous/story?id=37761302) are not enough to avoid potential corruption. 

The most promising solution to mitigate the shortage of ethical hacking is to increase the availability of hacking courses. Unviersities such as [Carnegie Melon](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~dbrumley/index.html) and University of Tulsa offer courses teaching the methodologies of software hacking and the faults that exist among revolutionary techonolgy. In reciprocation to such prevelent education, the dichotomous nature dividing hacking and ethical hacking becomes essential. Teaching students how to infiltrate health care databases could quickly produce the crime that ethical hackers are working to defeat. Thus, professors like [Sujeet Shenoi at Tulsa](https://www.washingtonpost.com/postlive/the-ethics-of-hacking-101/2014/10/07/39529518-4014-11e4-b0ea-8141703bbf6f_story.html?utm_term=.e645a6b02b4d) stress the importance of ethical and moral behavior and even vow not to "accept students who don’t promise to work, if hired, for the National Security Agency, the Energy Department or another U.S. government agency." Despite the setback that could potentially add to the hacking dilemma, courses in cyberoffense opens the doors for thousands of wellpaying, needed jobs.

However, a secondary conflict arises as various universities struggle to hire enough qualified staff in not only computer programming but professsors that specialize in hacking. 
Upon further research, I discovered countless websites offerring either free or low-priced packages to teach one of any background to ethically hack. Some packages, such as [BGR Acamedy](https://academy.bgr.com/sales/become-an-ethical-hacker-bonus-bundle?utm_source=bgr.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=become-an-ethical-hacker-bonus-bundle&utm_term=scsf-217859&utm_content=a0x1a000001s6sX), even offer certificates for completeing the course. Of course, however, the crediability of such courses offered outside of official institutions is questionable, and it is unclear if ethicality is stressed; but, just as a person can learn computer coding in the comfort of his/her own home, learning how to ethically hack falls under the same feasability. Georgoe Hotz, a [millionaire that gained public attention by being the first to hack Apple software](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-george-hotz-self-driving-car/) and eventually joining Product Zero, admits that "he learned most of what he knows on the Internet 'and from playing with things.'" Through self-taught information, Hotz surpassed brilliance to achieve minor, but still impressive, successes such as breaking into Playstation 3 to give the public restricted software, or magnamimous successes such as thought-controlled robots to deep-learning AI. 

By learning how to ethically hack, citizens can join [the battle against the NSA](https://www.wired.com/2014/06/end-to-end/) or defend the general public from zero-day vulnerabilities. There is an infinite collection of events highlighting the dangers of software insecurities that requires a greater population preventing the exploitation of its users. While [Wikileaks](https://wikileaks.org/What-is-Wikileaks.html) rigorously works to expose wrongfully restricted information involving war and corruption,
